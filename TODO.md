#TODO

- using a real database
- updating data
- typed input objects?
- security  https://dimitr.im/graphql-spring-security
- batching  
- subscriptions

- ~~using annotations~~ -> tried to find libraries but with no success:
    - SPQR only seemed to work with older versions of java-graphql and wasn't maintained well
    - graphql-java-annotations wasn't making life much easier
    - graphql-spring-annotations did not exist in maven repo, is it maintained?
